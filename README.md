# TodoMVC

This repo contains an example React App.

To clone, install and then start the TodoMWC app, run these commands:

```bash
## clone this repo to a local directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cypress-example-todomvc.git

## cd into the cloned repo
cd cypress-example-todomvc

## install the node_modules
npm install

## start the local webserver
npm start
```

The `npm start` script will spawn a webserver on port `8888` which hosts the TodoMVC app.

You can verify this by opening your browser and navigating to: [`http://localhost:8888`](http://localhost:8888)

You should see the TodoMVC app up and running.
